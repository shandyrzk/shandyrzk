### Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'am Shandy.
Hi! Iâ€™m an Information Systems graduate from Sebelas April University. I focus on system analysis, IT infrastructure, cloud computing, and web/software development. Iâ€™m curious, quick to learn, and love turning ideas into solutions. Looking forward to collaborating on impactful projects and growing along the way.
